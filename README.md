<p>I am a programmer, student, and an overall curious person for knowledge. At the age of 7, I sparked a curiosity for computer science as I learned Javascript by reading a book in my local library. Since then, I have been heavily engaged in topics that shackles your mind and challenge my limits of understanding. I enjoy Chess and participated in tournaments against other combatants, I won first place for all. I have a undefeated win streak at my school with over 10 wins against those lower and higher of my grade.</p>

<p>Every day, I aspire to be the greatest I can be. I actively seek out new lessons and topics to indulge myself in. My passion is to learn and learn everything that is available to me. I believe knowledge and education should be a top-priority for all to choose. I believe everyone has a chance to change their view on something deemed "complex, with a high learning curve" by the right of education 🏫 </p>
